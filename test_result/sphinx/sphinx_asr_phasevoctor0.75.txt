oh hey who will take that measure
hey who will that eats in my home
and he who will turn out the light
and he who will turn on my list hot sun
and he who will lose their phone now
o. k. who will read mail
hey port to open the way as the hay
a court to needy and warmer
and so turn out that moved here
and i'll come alive
